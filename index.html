                    <p>My teaching practice was at the School of Computing at the University of Cardiff. I contributed to the teaching of three modules. Two of the modules, “Developing quality software” (DQS) and  “Fundamentals of computing with Java” (JavaBSc) were part of the first year in Computing Science (CS). The DQS module was also part of the degree in Business Information Systems (BIS). The third module,“Object-Oriented Development with Java” (JavaMSc), was a part of the single year Masters in Computing.</p>
                    <p>The DQS module consisted of two parts: Software Engineering (SE), and Universal Markup Language (UML). The module was delivered as a mix of 24 lectures, 22 tutorials, 22 computer labs and 11 drop-ins. Each session was 60 minutes.  I was responsible for all of the tutorials, labs, drop-ins and 18 SE lectures. The six UML lectures were delivered by another member of staff. The module had 120 first year undergraduate students registered, 100 CS and 20 BIS. The age range of the students was from 19 to 40 with a median age of 20. The gender split on the CS course was 80/20 in favour of male students. For the BIS course it was 60/40 in favour of male students. All students had obtained level 5 qualifications but only a sub-set of them had a previous computing qualification. In the previous semester all of the students had completed an introductory programming module.  The module was assessed by four pieces of group work: two formative, two summative, and one individual  reflective report.</p>
                    <p>The JavaBSc module consisted of a mixture of 24 lectures, 22 computer labs, and 11 drop-ins. The module was organised and run by another member of staff who delivered all of the lectures and set the material that was to be presented, and tasks to be completed in the computer labs. My responsibility was to deliver the material for the computer labs and to supervise and help students with the computing tasks. In the drop-ins I was responsible for helping any students with any queries and problems they may have had. The labs were two hours each and the drop-ins one hour. The JavaBSc had the same 100 CS students that were registered for the DQS module. The JavaBSc was assessed by four summative individual tasks: two computer lab exams, one piece of coursework, and a written, closed book exam.</p>
                    <p>The JavaMSc module also consisted of a mixture of 24 lectures and 11 computing labs. As with the JavaBSc, the module content and delivery was by another member of staff, my responsibilities were to deliver the material for the computer labs and to supervise and help students with the computing tasks. The JavaMSc had only 20 students. The median age was mid to late 20s; the gender split was 19/1 male to female. All had a previous level 6 qualification. Ten students had no previous computing experience. This module was assessed by two summative exercises: a substantial individual project and a written, open book exam.</p>

                   <h2><b><a name="knowledge"></a>Knowledge</b></h2>
                    <p>Recalling memorized information. May involve remembering a wide range of 
                        material from specific facts to complete theories, but all that is required 
                        is the bringing to mind of the appropriate information. Represents the lowest 
                        level of learning outcomes in the cognitive domain. </p>
                    <p>Learning objectives at this level: know common terms, know specific facts, 
                        know methods and procedures, know basic concepts, know principles.</p>
                    <p>Question verbs: Define, list, state, identify, label, name, who? when? where? 
                        what?</p>
                    <h2><b><font size="+1"><a name="comprehension"></a></font>Comprehension</b></h2>
                    <p>The ability to grasp the meaning of material. Translating material from one 
                        form to another (words to numbers), interpreting material (explaining or summarizing), 
                        estimating future trends (predicting consequences or effects). Goes one step 
                        beyond the simple remembering of material, and represent the lowest level 
                        of understanding. </p>
                    <p>Learning objectives at this level: understand facts and principles, interpret 
                        verbal material, interpret charts and graphs, translate verbal material to 
                        mathematical formulae, estimate the future consequences implied in data, justify 
                        methods and procedures.</p>
                    <p>Question verbs: Explain, predict, interpret, infer, summarize, convert, translate, 
                        give example, account for, paraphrase</p>
                    <h2><b><a name="application"></a>Application</b></h2>
                    <p>The ability to use learned material in new and concrete situations. Applying 
                        rules, methods, concepts, principles, laws, and theories. Learning outcomes 
                        in this area require a higher level of understanding than those under comprehension. 
                      </p>
                    <p>Learning objectives at this level: apply concepts and principles to new situations, 
                        apply laws and theories to practical situations, solve mathematical problems, 
                        construct graphs and charts, demonstrate the correct usage of a method or 
                        procedure.</p>
                    <p>Question verbs: How could <i>x</i> be used to <i>y</i>? How would you show, 
                        make use of, modify, demonstrate, solve, or apply <i>x</i> to conditions <i>y</i>?</p>
                    <h2><b><a name="analysis"></a>Analysis</b></h2>
                    <p>The ability to break down material into its component parts. Identifying 
                        parts, analysis of relationships between parts, recognition of the organizational 
                        principles involved. Learning outcomes here represent a higher intellectual 
                        level than comprehension and application because they require an understanding 
                        of both the content and the structural form of the material. </p>
                    <p>Learning objectives at this level: recognize unstated assumptions, recognizes 
                        logical fallacies in reasoning, distinguish between facts and inferences, 
                        evaluate the relevancy of data, analyze the organizational structure of a 
                        work (art, music, writing).</p>
                    <p>Question verbs: Differentiate, compare / contrast, distinguish x from y, 
                        how does x affect or relate to y? why? how? What piece of x is missing / needed?</p>
                    <h2><b><a name="synthesis"></a>Synthesis</b></h2>
                    <p>(By definition, synthesis cannot be assessed with multiple-choice questions. 
                        It appears here to complete Bloom's taxonomy.)</p>
                    <p>The ability to put parts together to form a new whole. This may involve the 
                        production of a unique communication (theme or speech), a plan of operations 
                        (research proposal), or a set of abstract relations (scheme for classifying 
                        information). Learning outcomes in this area stress creative behaviors, with 
                        major emphasis on the formulation of new patterns or structure. </p>
                    <p>Learning objectives at this level: write a well organized paper, give a well 
                        organized speech, write a creative short story (or poem or music), propose 
                        a plan for an experiment, integrate learning from different areas into a plan 
                        for solving a problem, formulate a new scheme for classifying objects (or 
                        events, or ideas).</p>
                    <p>Question verbs: Design, construct, develop, formulate, imagine, create, change, 
                        write a short story and label the following elements:</p>
                    <h2><b><a name="evaluation"></a>Evaluation</b></h2>
                    <p>The ability to judge the value of material (statement, novel, poem, research 
                        report) for a given purpose. The judgments are to be based on definite criteria, 
                        which may be internal (organization) or external (relevance to the purpose). 
                        The student may determine the criteria or be given them. Learning outcomes 
                        in this area are highest in the cognitive hierarchy because they contain elements 
                        of all the other categories, plus conscious value judgments based on clearly 
                        defined criteria. </p>
                    <p>Learning objectives at this level: judge the logical consistency of written 
                        material, judge the adequacy with which conclusions are supported by data, 
                        judge the value of a work (art, music, writing) by the use of internal criteria, 
                        judge the value of a work (art, music, writing) by use of external standards 
                        of excellence.</p>
                    <p>Question verbs: Justify, appraise, evaluate, judge <i>x</i> according to 
                        given criteria. Which option would be better/preferable to party <i>y</i>?</p>

                    <p>I have had a varied and exciting career as a programmer. I have worked for a movie promotion company writing screensavers and web games for films from Star Trek to Beavis and Butthead. I have been the senior developer for a biotech start up and created three patented drug discovery programs. I have written computer models of low level radioactive waste, the spread of invasive trees in Australia, and genetically modified grass in the USA. I have even written a biome control program that ran on the old BBC B micro computer. In all this time I have not have been as excited about the state of computing as I am now. From the accessibility of cheap multi core computing power of the new Raspberry B 2, the vast and easily available data sets that are amenable to newly accessible forms of data mining, to the use of agent based models in all areas from biology to physics and economics. But most exciting of all is the new era of the Javascript web application. While the field of computing has generated a number of such fashions - Cyber, Web 2.0 and cloud - I strongly believe the new generation of always enabled javascript browser and the use of CommonJS is a new paradigm in computing. This new architecture opens limitless programming possibilities to anyone who has a computer with a browser. With the right knowledge, a lone programmer can produce an app used by hundreds of thousands; a small team of coders in an office can take on a corporation of hundreds. I want to be the person who helps that programmer to write that app or start that team.</p>
